2,i have seen a lot of movies in my time made in a lot of different styles from different genres from all around the world ive seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental i cant even remember the last time i came away from a movie thinking that id never seen anything like it but thats how i felt after rrrthis movie is so much its muchness may be a turn off to some and almost was for me my wife and i nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous but we got hooked and then i was totally in for the ride to the point where i was disappointed that this 3hour behemoth was endingdo you like to see musclebound slickedup men fighting tigers check how about public floggings that turn into musical numbers got it evil british people so extremely evil that england should sue the filmmakers for defamation sure how about evil british people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals you betcha beheadings yep romance of course homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay hooboy lets just say that anything not already in this movie isnt worth having anywaywatch rrr and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you dont care too much about because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen seriously this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that its almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one thanks a lot rrrgrade a,neutral
3,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
4,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
5,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
6,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
7,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
8,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
9,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
10,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
11,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
12,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

17,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
18,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
19,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
20,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
21,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
22,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
23,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
24,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
25,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
26,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

28,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
29,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
30,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
31,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral
32,i have seen a lot of movies in my time made in a lot of different styles from different genres from all around the world ive seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental i cant even remember the last time i came away from a movie thinking that id never seen anything like it but thats how i felt after rrrthis movie is so much its muchness may be a turn off to some and almost was for me my wife and i nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous but we got hooked and then i was totally in for the ride to the point where i was disappointed that this 3hour behemoth was endingdo you like to see musclebound slickedup men fighting tigers check how about public floggings that turn into musical numbers got it evil british people so extremely evil that england should sue the filmmakers for defamation sure how about evil british people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals you betcha beheadings yep romance of course homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay hooboy lets just say that anything not already in this movie isnt worth having anywaywatch rrr and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you dont care too much about because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen seriously this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that its almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one thanks a lot rrrgrade a,neutral
33,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
34,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
35,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
36,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
37,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
38,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
39,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
40,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
41,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
42,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

47,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
48,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
49,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
50,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
51,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
52,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
53,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
54,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
55,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
56,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

58,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
59,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
60,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
61,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

64,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
65,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
66,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
67,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
68,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
69,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
70,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
71,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
72,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

77,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
78,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
79,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
80,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
81,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
82,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
83,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
84,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
85,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
86,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
87,rrr 2022,neutral
88,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
89,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
90,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
91,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

94,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
95,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
96,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
97,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
98,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
99,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
100,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
101,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
102,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

107,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
108,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
109,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
110,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
111,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
112,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
113,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
114,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
115,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
116,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

118,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
119,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
120,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
121,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

124,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
125,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
126,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
127,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
128,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
129,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
130,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
131,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
132,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

137,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
138,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
139,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
140,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
141,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
142,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
143,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
144,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
145,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
146,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

148,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
149,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
150,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
151,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

154,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
155,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
156,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
157,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
158,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
159,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
160,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
161,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
162,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

167,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
168,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
169,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
170,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
171,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
172,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
173,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
174,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
175,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
176,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

178,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
179,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
180,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
181,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

184,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
185,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
186,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
187,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
188,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
189,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
190,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
191,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
192,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

197,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
198,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
199,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
200,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
201,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
202,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
203,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
204,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
205,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
206,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

208,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
209,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
210,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
211,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

213,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
214,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
215,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
216,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
217,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
218,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
219,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
220,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
221,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
222,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

227,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
228,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
229,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
230,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
231,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
232,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
233,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
234,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
235,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
236,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

238,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
239,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
240,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
241,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

244,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
245,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
246,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
247,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
248,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
249,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
250,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
251,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
252,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

257,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
258,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
259,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
260,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
261,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
262,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
263,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
264,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
265,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
266,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

268,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
269,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
270,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
271,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

274,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
275,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
276,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
277,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
278,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
279,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
280,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
281,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
282,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

287,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
288,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
289,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
290,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
291,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
292,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
293,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
294,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
295,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
296,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

298,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
299,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
300,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
301,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

303,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
304,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
305,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
306,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
307,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
308,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
309,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
310,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
311,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
312,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

317,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
318,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
319,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
320,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
321,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
322,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
323,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
324,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
325,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
326,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

328,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
329,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
330,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
331,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

333,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
334,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
335,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
336,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
337,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
338,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
339,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
340,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
341,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
342,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

347,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
348,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
349,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
350,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
351,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
352,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
353,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
354,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
355,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
356,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

358,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
359,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
360,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
361,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

364,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
365,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
366,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
367,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
368,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
369,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
370,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
371,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
372,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

377,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
378,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
379,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
380,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
381,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
382,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
383,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
384,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
385,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
386,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

388,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
389,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
390,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
391,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

394,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
395,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
396,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
397,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
398,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
399,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
400,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
401,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
402,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

407,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
408,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
409,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
410,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
411,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
412,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
413,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
414,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
415,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
416,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
417,rrr 2022,neutral
418,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
419,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
420,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
421,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

423,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
424,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
425,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
426,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
427,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
428,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
429,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
430,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
431,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
432,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

437,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
438,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
439,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
440,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
441,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
442,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
443,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
444,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
445,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
446,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

448,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
449,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
450,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
451,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

454,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
455,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
456,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
457,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
458,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
459,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
460,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
461,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
462,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

467,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
468,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
469,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
470,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
471,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
472,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
473,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
474,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
475,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
476,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

478,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
479,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
480,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
481,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

484,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
485,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
486,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
487,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
488,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
489,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
490,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
491,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
492,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

497,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
498,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
499,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
500,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
501,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
502,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
503,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
504,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
505,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
506,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
507,rrr 2022,neutral
508,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
509,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
510,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
511,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

513,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
514,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
515,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
516,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
517,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
518,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
519,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
520,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
521,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
522,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

527,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
528,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
529,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
530,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
531,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
532,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
533,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
534,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
535,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
536,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

538,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
539,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
540,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
541,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

544,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
545,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
546,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
547,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
548,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
549,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
550,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
551,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
552,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

557,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
558,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
559,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
560,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
561,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
562,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
563,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
564,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
565,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
566,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
567,rrr 2022,neutral
568,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
569,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
570,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
571,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

574,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
575,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
576,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
577,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
578,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
579,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
580,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
581,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
582,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

587,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
588,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
589,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
590,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
591,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
592,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
593,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
594,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
595,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
596,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

598,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
599,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
600,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
601,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

604,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
605,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
606,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
607,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
608,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
609,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
610,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
611,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
612,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

617,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
618,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
619,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
620,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
621,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
622,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
623,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
624,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
625,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
626,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

628,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
629,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
630,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
631,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

634,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
635,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
636,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
637,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
638,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
639,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
640,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
641,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
642,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

647,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
648,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
649,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
650,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
651,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
652,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
653,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
654,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
655,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
656,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

658,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
659,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
660,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
661,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

664,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
665,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
666,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
667,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
668,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
669,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
670,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
671,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
672,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

677,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
678,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
679,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
680,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
681,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
682,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
683,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
684,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
685,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
686,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
687,rrr 2022,neutral
688,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
689,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
690,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
691,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

694,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
695,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
696,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
697,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
698,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
699,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
700,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
701,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
702,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

707,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
708,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
709,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
710,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
711,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
712,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
713,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
714,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
715,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
716,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
717,rrr 2022,neutral
718,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
719,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
720,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
721,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

723,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
724,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
725,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
726,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
727,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
728,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
729,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
730,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
731,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
732,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

737,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
738,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
739,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
740,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
741,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
742,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
743,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
744,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
745,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
746,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
747,rrr 2022,neutral
748,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
749,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
750,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
751,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

754,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
755,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
756,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
757,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
758,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
759,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
760,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
761,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
762,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

767,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
768,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
769,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
770,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
771,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
772,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
773,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
774,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
775,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
776,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
777,rrr 2022,neutral
778,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
779,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
780,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
781,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

784,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
785,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
786,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
787,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
788,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
789,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
790,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
791,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
792,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

797,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
798,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
799,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
800,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
801,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
802,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
803,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
804,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
805,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
806,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
807,rrr 2022,neutral
808,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
809,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
810,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
811,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

813,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
814,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
815,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
816,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
817,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
818,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
819,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
820,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
821,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
822,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

827,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
828,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
829,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
830,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
831,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
832,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
833,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
834,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
835,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
836,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

838,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
839,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
840,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
841,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

844,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
845,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
846,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
847,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
848,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
849,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
850,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
851,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
852,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

857,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
858,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
859,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
860,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
861,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
862,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
863,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
864,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
865,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
866,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
867,rrr 2022,neutral
868,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
869,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
870,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
871,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

874,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
875,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
876,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
877,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
878,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
879,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
880,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
881,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
882,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

887,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
888,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
889,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
890,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
891,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
892,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
893,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
894,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
895,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
896,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
897,rrr 2022,neutral
898,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
899,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
900,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
901,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

903,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
904,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
905,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
906,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
907,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
908,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
909,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
910,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
911,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
912,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

917,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
918,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
919,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
920,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
921,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
922,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
923,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
924,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
925,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
926,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
927,rrr 2022,neutral
928,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
929,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
930,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
931,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

933,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
934,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
935,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
936,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
937,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
938,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
939,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
940,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
941,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
942,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

947,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
948,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
949,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
950,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
951,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
952,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
953,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
954,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
955,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
956,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
957,rrr 2022,neutral
958,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
959,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
960,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
961,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

963,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
964,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
965,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
966,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
967,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
968,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
969,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
970,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
971,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
972,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

977,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
978,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
979,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
980,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
981,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
982,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
983,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
984,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
985,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
986,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive
987,rrr 2022,neutral
988,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
989,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
990,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
991,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

993,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
994,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
995,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
996,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
997,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
998,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
999,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1000,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1001,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1002,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1007,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1008,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1009,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1010,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1011,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1012,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1013,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1014,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1015,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1016,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1018,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1019,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1020,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1021,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1023,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1024,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1025,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1026,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1027,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1028,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1029,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1030,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1031,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1032,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1037,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1038,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1039,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1040,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1041,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1042,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1043,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1044,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1045,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1046,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1048,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1049,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1050,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1051,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1053,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1054,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1055,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1056,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1057,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1058,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1059,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1060,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1061,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1062,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1067,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1068,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1069,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1070,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1071,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1072,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1073,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1074,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1075,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1076,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1078,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1079,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1080,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1081,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1083,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1084,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1085,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1086,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1087,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1088,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1089,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1090,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1091,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1092,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1097,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1098,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1099,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1100,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1101,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1102,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1103,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1104,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1105,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1106,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1108,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1109,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1110,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1111,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1114,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1115,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1116,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1117,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1118,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1119,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1120,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1121,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1122,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1127,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1128,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1129,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1130,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1131,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1132,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1133,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1134,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1135,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1136,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1138,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1139,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1140,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1141,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1144,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1145,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1146,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1147,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1148,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1149,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1150,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1151,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1152,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1157,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1158,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1159,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1160,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1161,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1162,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1163,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1164,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1165,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1166,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1168,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1169,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1170,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1171,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1174,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1175,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1176,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1177,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1178,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1179,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1180,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1181,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1182,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1187,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1188,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1189,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1190,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1191,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1192,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1193,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1194,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1195,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1196,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1198,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1199,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1200,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1201,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1203,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1204,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1205,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1206,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1207,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1208,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1209,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1210,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1211,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1212,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1217,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1218,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1219,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1220,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1221,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1222,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1223,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1224,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1225,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1226,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1228,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1229,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1230,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1231,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1233,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1234,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1235,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1236,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1237,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1238,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1239,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1240,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1241,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1242,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1247,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1248,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1249,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1250,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1251,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1252,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1253,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1254,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1255,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1256,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1258,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1259,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1260,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1261,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1264,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1265,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1266,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1267,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1268,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1269,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1270,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1271,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1272,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1277,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1278,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1279,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1280,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1281,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1282,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1283,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1284,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1285,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1286,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1288,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1289,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1290,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1291,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1293,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1294,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1295,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1296,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1297,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1298,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1299,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1300,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1301,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1302,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1307,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1308,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1309,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1310,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1311,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1312,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1313,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1314,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1315,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1316,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1318,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1319,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1320,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1321,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1324,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1325,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1326,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1327,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1328,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1329,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1330,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1331,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1332,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1337,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1338,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1339,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1340,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1341,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1342,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1343,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1344,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1345,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1346,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1348,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1349,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1350,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1351,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1354,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1355,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1356,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1357,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1358,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1359,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1360,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1361,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1362,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1367,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1368,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1369,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1370,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1371,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1372,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1373,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1374,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1375,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1376,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1378,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1379,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1380,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1381,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1383,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1384,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1385,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1386,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1387,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1388,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1389,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1390,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1391,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1392,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1397,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1398,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1399,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1400,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1401,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1402,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1403,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1404,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1405,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1406,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1408,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1409,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1410,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1411,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1413,i bet youd never think the mashup the heavyhanded rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of crouching tiger would work especially while mixing in several musical numbers those who think that would be wrong this movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness even with a 3hour runtime i was engrossed it was a great story with thorough character development a young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean british government who is controlling the people of malli presumably in india this small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back but the british government also has an indian soldier who is equally as skilled both of which dwarf all other soldiers as youll see in the spectacular opening scene as the two skilled fighters clash will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for this movie blew me away ive never seen special effects quite like this before there were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters this movie was produced with smart editing cinematography and choreography this is a modern must see,positive
1414,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1415,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1416,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1417,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1418,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1419,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1420,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1421,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1422,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1427,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1428,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1429,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1430,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1431,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1432,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1433,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1434,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1435,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1436,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1438,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1439,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1440,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1441,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1444,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1445,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1446,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1447,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1448,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1449,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1450,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1451,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1452,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1457,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1458,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1459,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1460,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1461,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1462,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1463,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1464,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1465,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1466,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1468,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1469,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1470,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1471,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral

1474,i have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because its not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently but i can say that for largescale bigbudget action movies this is how you do it right hollywood isnt incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion but many pale in comparison to rrr again without pointing out any movies in particular because i dont know whats directly comparable hollywood should take notesrrr has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epicsaction movies but it uses those tropes well things weve seen onscreen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if theyre used properly and rrr is a testament to thatthe amazing action is probably what stands out the most but at its core this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated theres some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie but ultimately its a good vs evil story thats pretty straightforward and honest about that and thanks to the great characters and strong performances that ends up being enoughtheres very little by way of slow scenes or dead air and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good i complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot and so i was really happy to find that rrr does its action so well amazing stunts great setups for the big set piece scenes a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat but not too much that it feels gratuitous and a way of making things overthetop in the best way possible so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys the two main heroes in this are almost superheroes which arguably makes rrr the best superhero film in yearsexcellent stuff a couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky english dialogue from the british characters is all i could criticise it for and theyre nitpicks this is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime,positive
1475,this was an incredible film i never heard of this film until netflix brought it up i saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it i am glad i did the dancing scene at the party was incredible arguably the scene was the best scene in the film but also the first scene where ram charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action comedy romance dancing and great storytelling,positive
1476,there is officially zero reason to watch gray man this is the only notsosemisubtle homoerotic netflix action epic we need a tightrope walk between complete silliness beautiful sincerity it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore insane action enveloping dialogue sprawling yet intimate storytelling elaborate dancing yep admittedly the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared but its hard to deny the bravura moviemaking daring you to not to have fun,neutral
1477,when i pushed play i did not really believe that i would ever watch the whole movie i just wanted to take a look and bail on itwell i was so wrong this movie is a freaken masterpiece combines some extraordinary drama stunning stunts and action great photography and absolutely beautiful music given that this is a bollywood movie you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting wont exactly be oscar worthy but none of it made me not enjoy this movie the time passed by very easily and i ended up having a really great timethe eye candy that is ram charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular that is one ridiculously handsome man i have to say p,positive
1478,so long story short word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we areits about friendship and honor and wants and well everything star wars prequels should have been its everything marvel should have beenthis movie is about 2 men super human some suspension of belief needs to be had view it as a super hero movie and it deliversplot its about 2 men a hero and the anti hero one has duty one has familyits an action movie think what avengers civil war batman vs superman should have been in modern american movies the overuse of cgi makes the movies look cheap rrr has cgi and some places it does look a little cheap but for a modern big budget film it deliversi have to give it between a 9 and 10 my expectations were low but the amazing actions scenes were filmed very well the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well donehighly recommended and a must see,neutral
1479,dont ask me for a plot because i didnt have a clue what was happening all i know is that i absolutely loved what i just watchedill admit i was captivated the other day when i watched jai bhim so i decided id opt for another indian movie rrr was suggested wow all i can say is wowthis is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films i think ive ever seen i loved it as wild and over the top as you can imagine all id say is please stick with it i know its a long film but its just so incredibly entertaining im not sure anyones going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events but boy does it hold your attentionthis film is violent dramatic shocking when funny you honestly dont know what on earth is going to come nextthe visuals are quite sensational it is one of the most visually decadent things i have ever seen the tiger and wolf scene that was mind blowing talk about getting the pulse racingwow those evil english people even if they did have accents that were closer to kentucky than kent are really evil they even make the british villains on murder she wrote seem subtleoutrageous 910,neutral
1480,it strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet whenever i venture to the studios of india and its array of languages innovations and stories the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive and quite often spectacular this is one such film a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more read the reviews of others if you want to know the story but take it from me if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire this is for you on a par with anything you may have come across in the past and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you which it surely will irresistible,positive
1481,the last time director ss rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film baahubali the conclusion it took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film rrr shoot and bring it to the silver screen pulling off a multistarrer with jr ntr and ram charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself but rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the storyrrr is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries alluri seetharama raju who waged an armed campaign against the british and komaram bheem a tribal from the gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people there is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meetingrrr runs on a relatively simple premise theres fire an angry young police officer ramaraju ram charan who is both revered and feared by the british he has done their every bidding for years he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet he is the one whos never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin then theres water sweet simple innocent bheem jr ntr who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose hes a gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called malli who was taken away by lady scott alison doody to be the singing doll on her mantelpiece but that is just the beginning of the talerajamoulis new calling cards seem to be building new world because despite being based on two revolutionaries from history rrr has a story thats completely fictional delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas bheem might have fought against the nizams so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the british that hes not to be taken lightly but he also finds shelter with muslims in delhi ramaraju might seem like a welltrained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle samuthirakani knows about scott ray stevenson might believe brown rubbish deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but jennifer olivia morris seems more empathetic this is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek this is the one where you use your hands as weaponsthe first half of rrr runs like clockwork theres the emotional core in malli theres the song and dance with naatu naatu itll make you smile and a friendship explored through dosti theres even a few laughs whenever bheem tries to befriend jennifer cinematic liberties are taken but they dont seem as noticable as in the later portions half where the film falters a bit the way ramarajus fianc sita alia bhatt is woven into the narrative apart from ram charans transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing after the way bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told the way ramarajus story unfolds seems strained the climax leaves more to be desired the good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverlynonetheless rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for a commercial action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained which it does the length also doesnt prove to be a hindrance thanks to a tight screenplay the vfx in certain portions couldve been better jr ntr pulls off his careers best performance hes charming as bheem especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find malli comes through well so does his love for ramaraju ram charan also does well pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through tarak and charans roles require them to have chemistry which they do alia bhatt olivia morris samuthirakani ajay devgn shriya saran and others play their parts well olivia in particular manages to win your heart alison and ray breeze through their roles keeravanis ost for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the bgm senthils camerawork is a delight toorrr is made for a big screen viewing the cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from rajamouli now the background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself it numbs us into submission but postinterval as the pace falters a little the pleasures dwindle toorrr is perfection by any means because after the way rajamouli pulls off certain scenes you wonder if he couldve done a better job in others but watch this one this weekend if youve been longing for a good action packed drama especially so if youre a fan of the lead duo,positive
1482,total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a david lean and as bloody and brutalist as mel gibson its certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former well duh kids but it also manages to be rapturously stupid its gruesome violence than anything the latter would do my wife with me also pointed out zack snyder but far superior visa vi heres a man with something to say and its loud and slow mo and i concur up to a point and if you dont like british people boys and girls have i got a smorgasbord of f the brits for you its alright theres the one good lady onebut what experiencing all 187 minutes of rrr truly is and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time is going to the all you can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours its a somber and powerful war movie a gritty run they the jungle slaughter fest a cornball treatise on friendship a at times very literally fiery call to arms against the british or any colonial power a sliver of romance for good measure for bheem and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting step up danceoff movie its exhausting and crude and at times laughable all those cgi animals oh my and i had an absolute blast you know what youre in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire if youre not with it by then leave and dont come backi know this is not historically accurate lol but who needs accuracy when the exploitationmeter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns this is gloriously crazy but its totally sincere oh and ray stevenson performance of his career if only aamir khan was here 5 stars easy,positive

1487,whole theatre goes mad on this one the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one even though we can guess this one but cant guess the scalesecond half starts with bit slow flashback but it picks up to the peak immediately second half has more sentiments and more screen space for rc rc outshines ntr in lot of places all the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable after credit janta song has cameo from rajamouli when the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebrationexceeding expectations in all aspects,neutral
1488,im not a native telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say im a fanboyrrr bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film the filmis three hours long but it never feel like itthe editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsthe film is casted perfectly ram charan has played his most wonderful character ntr has restraint yet powerful presence to the film alia bhatt is graceful all the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the olivia moris ajay devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the filmthe best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effectsthe action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excutedthe film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or anotherone of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years,positive
1489,rrrs strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief though no more than the average blockbuster and accepting the style of acting if you can get past that and if the violence isnt too much for you youre in for a treatthere is so much more heart in this movie than anything ive seen for a long while its nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action but more than the great camera work and fantastic music this movie sounds tremendous rrr knows how to setup a story from the very beginning screentime is being used to setup payoffs lateri can see the violence being an issue for some though rrr is not nearly as gory as many films but it can feel brutal at timesenough that i cant really call this a family filmone of the best films ive seen excellent,positive
1490,the action scenes were just as badass its so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that i loved it its basically a superhero movie the two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining the story itself was not bad even though it dragged so much during the middle part,negative
1491,this might be uncultured but i usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed this film completely broke that precedent as i loved every minute of it the characters the action the dancing the emotion everything was larger than life wellexecuted and mesmerizingthere were elements in this movie that i have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor the film is three hours long but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story the highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads the instant rapport and harmony between ram and bheem is inspiring which makes some of the later moments so poignantas a whole rrr is overthetop and big but also subtle and real in one moment i would be grinning ear to ear in the next i was crying and in the next i was gasping with excitement though there were elements i didnt fully understand i can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and i am anxious to give it another watchnote if watching at home i would recommend watching this film in two or three parts an intermission is helpfulnote 2 the dancing scene is an alltimernote 3 if there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters i would jump on it in a second,neutral
1492,we watched the oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from rrr it was overwhelming and spectacular so we searched out rrr here at home and watched the entire movie last night what a thrilling experience i had never seen anything quite like this the movie has everything spectacle action music dancing and singing drama and the list goes on the three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the indian film industry now a few questions why was this film not nominated for quite a number of oscars it should have been the indian entry in the international film category what about other oscar nominations for cinematograpy costuming music score film editing etc we have decided to search out more indian films available to us it must have been a wonderful experience to see rrr in a theatre on a large screen we highly recommend this fabulous exciting movie,neutral
1493,this movie is one of the greatest movies ive seen in my life not knowing that indian movies would actually execute so well especially this one the action is the best part of this movie no scene in this movie cannot go untouched without action even though on some parts i never understood what they were saying the subtitles helped and i understood this movie some scenes were ridiculously funny and stupid but made me realize how good this movie is take notes hollywood as this movie tops the majority of your movies today,positive
1494,if magadheera eega and the baahubali movies were a mere teaser of what s s rajamouli is capable of as a filmmaker rrr is the feature length definition of his ability to create cinema that transcends language and nativity barriers eventually delivering what many try but fail to deliver universal entertainment rrr is an intense action drama with all the makings of a perfect visual spectacle and experiencing it in 3d would only make it better ranging from the grand production values to resonant emotions to the outstanding action sequences rrr is epic in every sense of the word and truly ravishing refreshing and recommendablethe film might be around three hours long but it never actually feels like a long film in fact times flies by really quick while watching rrr an explosive cinematic blockbuster which has entertainment for all ages in spite of the ua rating the cinematography the visual effects and the fight and dance choreography are some of the key highlights of the film aside from the terrific performances by jr ntr ram charan and others ajay devgn and alia bhatt shine in their brief yet integral roles one more good thing is the songs never hinder the storytelling and instead make the experience more and more fun and then we have the fights and stunts which totally dominate the show and deliver a bang for the buck which is what any action buff could ask forplus director s s rajamouli has beautifully handled the depiction of his films two heroes giving them a balanced amount of focus so that the viewers can never call just one of them the main hero also the background music is gold and a major asset to the proceedings editing is razorsharp and the sets look grand rrr only reinstates the fact that s s rajamouli is the undisputed king of period action dramas in india and that other filmmakers have a lot to learn from him i would definitely recommend watching rrr and suggest you not to leave the seat until the very end otherwise you might miss some important parts this is what cinema exists for and you dont need to think too much before booking your tickets,positive
1495,its brutal ridiculous actionpacked fun entertaining yet again brutal masculine it has all these qualities modern american movies cant possibly have anymore so no wonder this indian movie is doing so well in the westpeople needed itand i needed this my only real issue is that its 3 hours long but man its 3 hours packed with insane action superb music lots of tension and lots of raw testosterone its absolutely crazy how long its been since ive seen a movie like thisand its not just all that its generally flawlessly executed its perfect at what its trying to be great job india show those weaklings how its done remind them how fun and awesome movies can be,positive
1496,rrr is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year its been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful tollywood films of all time my question is whyim not familiar at all with tollywoodbollywood movies this was the first one ive seen all the way through but prior to watching rrr i was familiar with all of the bollywood clichs and have seen numerous infamous clips on youtube theyre all very over the top with their presentation and acting theyre all very long and they all include several dancemusical numbers but i figured since this was the first tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie something that stood out and there really isntas i was watching rrr i thought to myself what if this was an american film and it featured the same story the same action scenes and the same length i would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated too tonally inconsistent having bad cgi effects terrible pacing underdeveloped romantic subplots and onedimensional villains but i guess since this is a tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine do they add to the charm of this film i dont know but im honestly lowkey baffled by the reception that rrr is gettingand im also baffled by how this tollywood film looks just like every other indian action film that has come out for the past several years seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other indian blockbustershere are a few positives i can give this film there is some nice direction and cinematography both of the lead actors have good chemistry some of the action scenes are fun some are also completely stupid and sometimes the score is good and sometimes its not and very random clearly indian blockbuster films are just not for me ill acknowledge that cinema is subjective so to the people who genuinely love this movie im happy for you but i still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and i still think its easily the most overrated film to come out this year by a lot,positive

1498,thats the best brief for the film i can think of ss rajamouli has been making massfriendly commercial films for a long time but bahubali brought him panindia popularity he became a household name and a brand so naturally anything he would do after bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too the same happened with prabhas when he came after bahubali with saaho and radhe shyam lets just accept the fact that a film like bahubali the conclusion 2017 cant be made again and again not just because it was a massive blockbuster but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays when i saw bahubali 2 i called it the greatest commercial entertainer of this millennium after gadar 2001 surprisingly these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore tickets in the hindi belt it was acceptable to see such heroic characters in bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period which makes it reasonable but with rrr it cant be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century where you expect some humanly possible stuff it doesnt matter how big fictionally your character is it has to make some sense when it comes to onscreen persona as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood and it all came with human restrictions rrr looks problematic in that sense but if you talk about mass cinema then rrr is simply phenomenalrrr is a fictional tale set in the 1920s two indian revolutionaries rama raju ram charan and komaram bheem jr ntr try to fight the mighty british empire and nizam of hyderabad in their own ways which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by british officer steve ray stevenson and his wife lady scott alison doody while rama is a british cop who tries to stop him two powerful heroes one fire and one water are pitted against each other and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past eventsrrr presents ram charan and jr ntr in neverseenbefore avatars rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls ram charan enters with a 5minute long action scene which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind but thats what mass cinema means right on the other hand jr ntr has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too that entire forest sequence will blow your mind a good happy warning to all tarak fans please keep your expectations high because bheem is going to exceed all of them the pair of rama and bheem work like a fireworks display during all those largescale action sequences talking about the supporting cast especially two hindi actors ajay devgn and alia bhatt both have small but important cameos ajay devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again and in other news the sky is blue this man has some charisma of his own its only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly alia bhatt as sita looks gorgeous in every single scene and her character plays a vital part in the narrative olivia morris sparkles the screen with her beauty and her accent is too cute alison doody is the exact opposite of that but thats what the villainous characters do both samuthirakani and shriya saran appear in small roles and both pass with good gradesrrrs basic script is as good as any telugu action drama mind you some call it mindless but the screenplay doesnt match that certain level you are expecting the second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too all those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the bigscreen extravaganza in 3d the action sequences of rrr have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in india rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done bahubali that film still had battlefield references to help a bit but rrr despite being driven by two characters provides a better visual spectacle than bahubali thats not a small thing mind you the music of rrr is going to create some hysteria in theatres if you dont feel like dancing while naacho naacho id say please consult a doctor you are not normal dosti has got nice tunes for a situational song and komuram bheemudo will take you all by surprise im not sure if you can hear raamam raaghavam clearly because there will be a lot of noise including big screams and whistles going around at the time but youll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching homeits been more than two years since we havent had a big panindia event film and ss rajamouli brings back that much needed bigscreen experience for us undoubtedly the best director in india when it comes to commercial cinema the name is ss rajamouli his extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in india bahubali was an ordinary script but its rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film no matter how many resemblances you find between it and the lion king or its original source material shakespeares hamlet its a story every indian can relate to thats the same case with rrr despite some flaws in the writing but thats where rajamoulis genius mind works overtime he presents the highoctane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy the hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that preinterval rampage or even that mindboggling climax in the forest ss rajamouli has outdone himself he has reached a level that other commercial directors in indian cinema can never reach or even dream about give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it thats what he has done with rrr every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him as a whole rrr packs a solid punch of outandout commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the bahubali juggernaut just dont mind the below average writing and you are going to love itrating 610,positive
1499,rrr is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle however the storyline is super weak jr ntrs connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire rams motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the british to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare lots of sequences in the movie also doesnt make sense like jr ntr spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals transport them to the city feed them for months and then unleash them on the british army please that was so funny then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker i mean cmon rajamouli bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals here the visuals are mediocre story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe the actors have done well though good chemistry and required machismo especially ram charan hopefully we get such fundsresources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story,positive
1500,watched it in 3d some scenes are like over the top and illogical you dont expect this from rajamaulis movie there were some boring scenes as well story is not so trong vfx is good some section scenes are also good overall after bahubali and bahubali 2 rajamauli disappointed me,positive
1501,there is no doubt that i am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour there is no questioning this films technical achievements which are many the cgi could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film this begins with a girl in india being kidnapped by a british governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that hundreds if not thousands die throw all logic out the window with this one everything in this film is overthetop the action the story the characters the violence even the music it is beautiful to look at no doubt but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch but turn off your brain before viewing the actors put a lot into this especially the two leads but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are cecille b demille would be envious,neutral
